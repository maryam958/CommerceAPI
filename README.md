### 📘 Complete API Usage Guide
#### 1. Register a New User  
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/auth/signUp`  
**Description:** Create a new user account.  
**Request Body (JSON):**
```json
{
    "userName": "maryam",
    "email": "maryammohamedsobhy357@gmail.com",
    "password": "Test123",
    "cPassword": "Test123"

}
```

Successful Response (201 Created):
```json
{
    "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to confirm your account.",
    "savedUser": {
        "userName": "maryam",
        "email": "maryammohamedsobhy357@gmail.com",
        "password": "$2a$09$rRMFNFsj3zwX.PoqLCJLHO0T25qGZpCD6kwExEcd6tBa8ES1Ozqy6",
        "role": "User",
        "active": false,
        "confirmEmail": false,
       ...
    }
}


```
- Note: The user account is created but inactive until the email is confirmed.

##### ⚠️ Edge Case:
**Email Already Registered but Not Confirmed**
If a user tries to register again using the same email without confirming it first, the API responds:

Response (409 Conflict):

```json
{
  "message": "This email is already registered but not yet confirmed. Please check your inbox to confirm your email."
}
```
🔗 Email Confirmation Flow
After registration, a confirmation email is sent.

The user must click the confirmation link to activate their account.

Without confirmation, they cannot log in or re-register with the same email.
